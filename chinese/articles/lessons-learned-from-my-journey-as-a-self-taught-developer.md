![Lessons Learned from My Journey as a Self-Taught Developer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/size/w2000/2020/05/1_DAP7LzvAGemiogLG4lSnWA--1-.png)

The path of the self-taught developer is tough and filled with uncertainty. There is no straight line from newbie to career programmer. Because of this, I believe all self-taught developers have a unique story to tell.
自学成为开发者的道路困难且充满不确定性。从菜鸟到专业程序员没有捷径。正因为如此，我相信所有的自学成才开发者都有独特的故事。
In this article, I’ll share my coding journey through a series of lessons I learned along the way. Hopefully reading about my experience teaching myself how to code will help you reflect on your own past, and motivate you to keep moving forward.
在这篇文章中，我将分享在写代码道路上我吸取到的一系列教训。希望通过阅读我自学编程的经历将帮助你反思你的过去，并能激励你继续向前走。
## Lesson #1: Focus on the Process
#第一课#关注过程
When I first started learning to program, I never had the intention of making a career out of it. I just wanted to make a specific app.
当我开始学习编程时，我从来没有打算以它为职业。我只是想做一个特别的app。
My journey started when I was a senior in college. I just finished Richard Branson’s biography and I was probably reading too much TechCrunch. I was pumped full of entrepreneurial energy.
我的旅程开始于大学的高年级。我刚看完理查德·布兰森的传记且看了过多的科技博客。我充满了创业激情。
I was constantly reading about how college kids were receiving massive amounts of investment for their mobile app ideas. I thought I could be one of those college kids.
我不断地阅读有关大学生通过手机应用程序来获得大量投资的故事。我想我也可以成为其中一员。
One day, while walking in between classes, an app idea hit me. I quickly became convinced that I’d found the next big thing.
一天，我在课间散步时，一个app想法出现了。我迅速地确信那会是下一件大事。
I was consumed by the idea and stopped paying attention to lectures. My excitement for the app idea quickly grew to the point where I felt I needed to take action.
我被这个想法迷住了不再专心听课。我的兴奋迅速发展到了我需要采取行动的时刻。
There was one big problem. My idea was a mobile app and I didn’t know anyone who could build mobile apps.
有个大问题。我的想法是手机应用但是我不认识任何人会做手机应用。
So I thought, "what the hell, how hard could programming be?" I was losing interest in my major and I was spending a lot of time playing Xbox. I could put some of my free time towards building out my mobile app idea.
所以我想，“到底怎么回事？编程会有多难？”我对我的专业失去了兴趣并花了更多的时间玩Xbox。我会用我一些业余时间想怎么造我的手机应用。
Sometimes being naive helps you take action when you normally wouldn’t.
有时候天真会帮你采取行动而你不会这么做。
I was a college student with no programming, business, or design experience trying to learn Android so I could build a complex mobile app. I guess that’s what you get when you mix a big idea with the Silicon Valley hype machine.
我是一个不会编程，商业或者设计经验的大学生，尝试去学Angroid这样我就能造一个复杂的手机应用。我想这就是当你把一个大创意和硅谷的炒作机器混在一起时得到的。
I wish I could tell you things went well from here.

I bought a few books on Android development and spent countless hours in my room trying to duct-tape my app together. I didn’t care how the app worked, I just wanted a finished product.我买了几本关于Android开发的书，花了无数个小时在我的房间里试图把我的应用程序粘在一起。我不在乎这个应用程序是如何工作的，我只是想要一个成品。
Time went on and the app turned into a Frankenstein of copy and pasted code. The app didn’t have many features and it barely ran without crashing.
随着时间的推移，这个应用程序变成了一个复制粘贴代码的科学怪人。这个应用程序没有太多的功能，运行起来几乎没有崩溃。
It wasn’t until I accidentally got into a Computer Science class that I realized that I should focus more on actually trying to learn software development.
直到我偶然上了一堂计算机科学课，我才意识到我应该把更多的精力放在学习软件开发上。
My inability to program lead me to abandon my initial app idea. I'd come to the realization that I wasn’t going to make the next big thing, at least not yet.
我无法编程导致我放弃了最初的应用程序想法。我开始意识到我不会做出下一件大事，至少现在还没有。
Over time I corrected my behavior and took learning more seriously. I started to enjoy programming and eventually started a career as a software developer.
随着时间的推移，我纠正了自己的行为，并更加认真地对待学习。我开始喜欢编程，最终开始了软件开发的职业生涯。
My big app idea consumed me for a long time. It put my focus on the end result rather than the process of getting there.
我的大应用程序创意让我耗费了很长时间。它把我的注意力放在最终结果上，而不是到达目的地的过程。
When you get too focused on the end result, you start taking shortcuts. Shortcuts might lead some short-term progress but in the long run, your lack of knowledge will always catch up to you.
当你过于专注于最终结果时，你开始走捷径。捷径可能会带来一些短期的进步，但从长远来看，你知识的缺乏总会赶上你。


It’s important to remember that learning anything big, like programming, requires many small steps. Each step will need to be treated with care.
很多重要的步骤都需要记住。每一步都需要小心对待。


Learning new things is like building a house. You start with the foundation and build up. If the foundation is faulty the whole thing will crumble down sooner or later.
学习新事物就像盖房子。你从基础开始，建立起来。如果地基有缺陷，整个东西迟早会崩溃的。


Sometimes building a strong foundation requires you to slow down. There’s no shame in going slow. The people who understand the basics the first time will end up getting ahead of the people who have to go back and relearn them.
有时候，建立一个坚固的基础需要你放慢速度。慢一点也不丢人。那些第一次了解基础知识的人最终会领先于那些不得不回去重新学习的人。


There’s an old Chinese proverb that goes:

> "It is better to take many small steps in the right direction than to make a big leap forward only to stumble backward."中国有句古老的谚语：



>“朝着正确的方向迈出许多小步，总比大跃进只会跌跌撞撞地倒退要好。”



重要的不是你能做得多快，而是你能正确地做得有多慢。



It's not how fast you can do something, it's how slowly you can do it correctly.

I was a perfect example. From the outside, it might’ve looked like I was a programming whiz kid. In reality, I couldn’t build an app to save my life.

Focus on the process and you will surprise yourself with how much progress you make each day.
我就是一个完美的例子。从外表上看，我可能是个编程天才。事实上，我无法建立一个应用程序来拯救我的生命。
专注于这个过程，你会惊讶于你每天都取得了多大的进步。



## Lesson #2: Stack Overflow is Awesome (But Dangerous)
##第2课：Stack Overflow非常棒（但很危险）


As I was building my killer app, Stack Overflow became my best friend.
当我在构建我的杀手级应用程序时，堆栈溢出成了我最好的朋友。


Anytime I got stuck I would try to craft together a perfect question to ask the Stack Overflow community. I averaged a few questions a day.
每当我遇到麻烦的时候，我都会想办法想出一个完美的问题来问Stack Overflow社区。我平均每天问几个问题。


Not only would I post questions, but I would also treat the answers on Stack Overflow as Gospel. I would spend a crazy amount of time scouring the site to try to find an exact chunk of code that would fix my problem.
我不仅会发帖提问，而且还会把栈溢出的答案当作福音。我会花大量的时间搜索网站，试图找到一个确切的代码块来解决我的问题。


When I found a suitable answer, I would copy and paste it right into my codebase and try to make it work with my existing code. I spent little time trying to understand the code I was adding.
当我找到一个合适的答案时，我会复制并粘贴到我的代码库中，并尝试让它与我现有的代码一起工作。我花了很少的时间来理解我正在添加的代码。
I made brute-force trial and error a new art form.
我把暴力试错变成了一种新的艺术形式
This process went on for a while until eventually, I wised up and realized the flaws of my approach.
这个过程持续了一段时间，直到最后，我发现了我的方法的缺陷。


Stack Overflow is a blessing and a curse. It’s great at helping you solve problems – however, if you aren’t careful, you can quickly become dependent on the website.

Sometimes the website is too good at solving problems. It creates a false sense of confidence that can lead to more headaches down the road.

Stack Overflow shows you how to get something to work but it doesn't usually explicitly tell you why it works.

Understanding the how is important. Bugs need to be fixed and code needs to run.

However, understanding why something works is what's going to help you apply the knowledge again in the future.

It's like the quote...Stack Overflow是福也是祸。它在帮助你解决问题上很有帮助——但是，如果你不小心，你很快就会依赖网站。



有时候网站太擅长解决问题了。它制造了一种错误的自信感，可能会导致今后更多的头痛。



Stack Overflow向您展示了如何使某些东西工作，但它通常不会显式地告诉您它为什么工作。



了解“如何”很重要。bug需要修复，代码需要运行。



然而，理解某些东西为什么有用，这将有助于你将来再次应用这些知识。



就像引用

> "Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime."
“给人一条鱼，你就喂他一天。教一个人钓鱼，你就可以养活他一辈子。”

Copy and pasting code from Stack Overflow is like giving someone a fish. Understanding why a snippet of code works is like teaching them to fish.

There's nothing wrong with copying and pasting code. We all do it. It's only a problem when it becomes a crutch and stunts our growth as a developer.
从一个鱼的复制和粘贴堆栈就像有人。理解一段代码的作用就像教他们钓鱼一样。



复制和粘贴代码没有错。我们都这么做。只有当它成为一个拐杖并阻碍我们作为开发者的成长时，它才是一个问题。


The thing I had to learn the hard way was that it's impossible to learn anything if the answers are constantly given to you. There are no short-cuts in the learning process.

When you're stuck, attempt to solve your coding problem at least a few times before going to Google.

When you find yourself copying and pasting code, spend a little time trying to understand the code snippet before moving on.

我不得不艰难地学习的是，如果不断地给你答案，就不可能学到任何东西。在学习过程中没有捷径。



当你陷入困境时，试着在上谷歌之前至少解决几次你的编码问题。



当您发现自己在复制和粘贴代码时，请在继续之前花一点时间来理解代码片段。
## Lesson #3: Learn How to Find Experienced Help

The first thing I did after I decided I wanted to learn programming was buy two Android development books.

At the start, I followed the exercises in the books closely and worked through the example projects. However, I quickly got frustrated with the progress I was making following the book and decided to go off and figure out how to program on my own.

As you’ve read above, that slowly resulted in disaster.

I spent countless hours isolated in my room trying to figure out simple programming problems. I was getting stuck on every new line of code and it didn't feel like I was making much progress.

I was helplessly stuck and my life was a cocktail of doubt, frustration, and an overwhelming feeling of being lost.

To make matters worse, I had the bright idea to start using a massive C library called FFMPEG. My app needed to edit videos, so I thought it was a good idea to utilize the library’s robust functionality.

It wasn’t my smartest move, considering at the time, I could barely get my Android app working.

I wasted a lot of time trying to read the C code and figuring out how I could use it in my app. I struggled to even get the library imported into my Android project. The Android code and C code didn't want to play nice.

After many hours of getting nowhere, I eventually became frustrated and abandoned the library.

Around the same time as the FFMPEG debacle, I signed up for an Object Oriented Programming class. I'm honestly not sure how I got in. I later found out that I was the only non-Computer Science major in the class. I think there was a bug in the enrollment software.

The first assignment was to build a Blackjack program. I’d been teaching myself programming for 5-6 months at this point, and I felt somewhat confident with my skills.

I finished the assignment and felt good about my work.

It didn't take long for that feeling to fade.

My whole program was written in one huge method. Just about everyone else in the class was able to pick up on the fact that the program needed to be separated into classes.

Not good.

Luckily, the classwork and guidance from the teacher allowed me to take a step back from my Android app and reflect on my programming abilities. I started to value learning and reigned back my desires to make a completed app.

I've now come to realize that if I would've spoken to just **one** experienced developer in those early days, they would’ve seen what I was doing. I could have set my priorities straight, and talked some sense into me. They would’ve helped me correct my path when I was going down useless dead ends (like trying to work with FFMPEG).

Instead, I isolated myself from the world partially because I felt like there wasn’t anyone who could help me.

Isolation is a double-edged sword. On one side, it helps you focus on the task at hand. On the flip side, it removes you from the world, starving you of crucial feedback.

There were a lot of ways I could’ve found help. I could’ve tried to find a professor/student at the university with Android experience or looked to the local community for help. I also could’ve tried finding an online Android community.

Experienced developers are like a compass. They won’t get you to your destination but they will make sure you are pointed in the right direction. Their help can often be the difference between success and failure.

Make sure you seek out guidance wherever you can find it. It will save you time and frustration down the road.
##第3课：学习如何寻找有经验的帮助

当我决定要学编程之后，我做的第一件事就是买两本Android开发书籍。

一开始，我密切关注书中的练习，并完成了示例项目。然而，我很快就对我跟随这本书所取得的进展感到沮丧，于是决定自己动手去做编程。

正如你在上面读到的，这慢慢导致了灾难。

我花了无数个小时与世隔绝，试图解决简单的编程问题。我被困在每一行新的代码，感觉我没有取得太大的进展。

我无助地陷入困境，我的生活充满了怀疑、挫折和无法抗拒的失落感。

更糟糕的是，我有了一个聪明的主意，开始使用一个名为FFMPEG的大型C库。我的应用程序需要编辑视频，所以我认为利用图书馆强大的功能是个好主意。

这不是我最聪明的举动，当时考虑到，我几乎无法让我的安卓应用程序正常工作。

我浪费了很多时间去阅读C代码，想知道如何在我的应用程序中使用它。我甚至很难将这个库导入到我的Android项目中。Android代码和C代码不想玩得好。

经过几个小时的无所事事之后，我终于灰心丧气，放弃了图书馆。

大约在FFMPEG崩溃的同时，我注册了一个面向对象的编程类。我真的不知道我是怎么进来的。后来我发现我是班上唯一一个非计算机专业的学生。我想注册软件有个错误。

第一项任务是建立21点程序。我对自己的编程技巧有了6个月的自信。

我完成了任务，对自己的工作感觉很好。

没过多久那种感觉就消失了。

我的整个程序是用一个巨大的方法编写的。几乎班上的其他人都能意识到程序需要被分成几个类。

不好的。

幸运的是，老师的课堂作业和指导让我从Android应用程序中退一步，反思自己的编程能力。我开始重视学习，并控制了自己制作完整应用程序的欲望。

我现在开始意识到，如果我在早期只和**一个**有经验的开发人员交谈，他们就会看到我在做什么。我本可以理清我的优先顺序，并告诉我一些道理。当我陷入无用的死胡同（比如尝试使用FFMPEG）时，它们会帮助我纠正路径。

实际上，我把自己与世界隔绝，部分原因是我觉得没有人能帮助我。

孤立是一把双刃剑。一方面，它可以帮助你专注于手头的工作。另一方面，它把你从这个世界上赶走，让你缺乏重要的反馈。

我有很多方法可以找到帮助。我可以试着在大学里找一个有安卓系统经验的教授/学生，或者向当地社区寻求帮助。我也可以尝试寻找一个在线的安卓社区。

有经验的开发人员就像指南针。他们不会把你带到目的地，但他们会确保你的方向是正确的。他们的帮助往往是成功与失败的区别。

一定要在任何你能找到的地方寻求指导。这会节省你的时间和挫折感。


## Lesson #4: Craft Your Environment

This might be the only thing I felt like I did right when I was teaching myself programming.

Throughout my life, I’ve been really bad at studying for tests or doing my homework at home. There are just too many distractions at any given moment. I would often try to find refuge in libraries or coffee shops.

Luckily I applied this rule when I was teaching myself programming.

I ended up becoming a regular at a few local coffee shops. I preferred coffee shops over other study locations because they provided some variety and it’s easy to hide (easy access to caffeine doesn’t hurt either).

If I was studying at home, I made sure my door was shut and my roommates knew not to disturb me for a certain period of time.

Regardless of where I was, I would make sure my music was loud enough so I couldn’t hear what was going on around me.

I can’t say I was perfect at finding a distraction-free work environment but I was able to succeed a majority of the time.

Having the right work environment is often an overlooked part of learning.

Focus is a foundational component of memory and skill acquisition. When you try to learn something new, the strength of the learning is directly linked to the intensity of your focus. When your focus is weak, new information will be less sticky which will result in slower learning and more time studying.

Your work environment should be distraction-free and should allow for long uninterrupted stretches of focus. Even with COVID-19 making it necessary to work remotely, there are still actions you can take to design your learning environment.

Here are a few things you can do:

-   Find a location where people won’t interrupt you
-   Put your phone in airplane mode
-   Use some sort of timed website blocker for social media and news sites
-   Wear headphones and listen to non-distracting music (preferably a long playlist so you don’t have to constantly switch songs)
-   Avoid TV or other highly stimulating surroundings
-   Have a notebook nearby to write down any tasks or ideas that pop into your head
-   Make it known to the people around you that you don't want to be disturbed

Only you can decide where and how to craft your environment. But make sure you do, because it’s worth it.
##第4课：打造你的环境

这可能是我在自学编程时唯一觉得做得对的事情。

在我的一生中，我一直很不擅长为考试而学习，也不擅长在家做作业。任何时候都有太多的干扰。我经常试图在图书馆或咖啡馆寻求庇护。

幸运的是，我在自学编程时应用了这条规则。

最后我成了当地几家咖啡店的常客。我更喜欢咖啡店而不是其他的研究地点，因为它们提供了一些多样性，而且很容易隐藏（很容易接触到咖啡因也没有坏处）。

如果我在家学习，我会确保我的门是关着的，我的室友知道在一段时间内不要打扰我。

不管我身在何处，我都会确保我的音乐足够大声，这样我就听不到周围发生了什么。

我不能说我在寻找一个没有分心的工作环境方面是完美的，但大多数时候我都能成功。

拥有合适的工作环境往往是学习过程中被忽视的一部分。

专注是记忆和技能获得的基础。当你尝试学习新事物时，学习的强度与你专注的强度直接相关。当你的注意力不集中时，新信息的粘性就会降低，这会导致学习速度变慢，学习时间也会更长。

你的工作环境应该是没有分心的，应该允许长时间不间断的专注。即使COVID-19使远程工作成为必要，你仍然可以采取行动来设计你的学习环境。

以下是您可以做的一些事情：



-找一个不会被人打扰的地方

-把你的手机置于飞行模式

-在社交媒体和新闻网站上使用某种定时网站拦截器

-戴上耳机，听一些不会分散注意力的音乐（最好是一个长播放列表，这样你就不必经常切换歌曲）

-避免看电视或其他刺激性很强的环境

-在附近放一个笔记本，记下你脑海中出现的任何任务或想法

-让周围的人知道你不想被打扰

只有你能决定在哪里以及如何创造你的环境。但一定要做，因为这是值得的。
## Lesson #5: Get Out Into the World and Meet People

Landing my first programming job was sort of a random occurrence.

I just moved to Omaha, Nebraska and I had around a year of self-taught development under my belt.

I knew very few people in Omaha, so I searched [Meetup.com][1] to try and find other people interested in Android development. I found a Meetup focused on mobile development which covered both iOS and Android development and I decided to go.

Going to that first meeting was nerve-racking. I spent around 10 minutes in my car at the venue deciding if I should go in or drive off.

I was intimidated. I wasn’t confident of my programming skills and I knew everyone at the Meetup had much more experience than I did.

I finally said, screw it and went inside.

I’m glad I did.

I started to attend regularly and during one Meetup, not too long after I moved to Omaha, I met a recruiter who was looking for an Android contractor. We talked for a while and I got an interview for the job later that week.

Before the interview, I felt confident. During the interview, I was a deer in the headlights.

The interviewer was talking about the project I’d be working on and it all went right over my head. I tried to stay engaged but they could tell it was out of my range.

After the interview, they asked me to hang-out for an hour so I could talk to someone else. Knowing I blew it, I walked around downtown trying to clear my head.

I ended up interviewing with someone else at the company, and shortly after, they offered me an internship.

I was so shocked that after I signed all the paperwork and got my work laptop running, I went over to the CEO and asked if it was a paid internship or not.

The internship turned into a full-time job and I started my career as a software developer.

When you are self-taught, people are not going to come and seek you out. You will need to find opportunities for yourself.

Graduates of four-year universities and code schools have the advantage of leveraging their school's network when finding a job. Self-taught developers don’t have this luxury.

Self-taught developers will need to go out into the world and build their networks themselves.

Cold calling employers and sending out resumes can work. However, I've found people like hiring people who are close to them in their social network.

Websites like [Meetup.com][2] are great for finding monthly programming-specific groups. Even in a pandemic, there are still many virtual Meetups that are very informative and beneficial.

There are also other Slack channels or Discord communities that you can leverage to make meaningful relationships. You can also try reaching out to various people in your area and ask to have a quick 15-minute virtual coffee with them.

Do what you can to build up the nerve to reach out and talk with people. Be friendly and talk to them about your experiences. Make sure people know of your long-term goal of finding a job.

Put yourself in situations where something positive might happen. You can’t win a raffle if you never buy a ticket.

Consider any opportunity that comes your way, because even if it looks like a dead-end, it has the potential to lead to something bigger.

My internship was a huge pay-cut to the other offers I had at the time. However, I knew if I worked hard it would be an opportunity for me to break into the tech industry.

The key is to think of job opportunities in the long-term. Internships or part-time jobs might not give you your desired salary upfront but they might open up doors in the future.
#第五课：走出去，与人见面

我第一次完成编程工作是一种随机的事情。

我刚搬到内布拉斯加州的奥马哈，我带着一年自学的发展。

我在奥马哈认识的人很少，所以我搜查了[Meetup.com][1] 去尝试寻找其他对Android开发感兴趣的人。我发现一个会议集中在移动开发上，它涵盖了iOS和Android开发，我决定去。

去第一次会议真是太令人费劲了。我在会场的车里花了大约10分钟，决定我是应该进去还是开车。

我被吓坏了。我对我的编程技巧不太自信，我知道在会议上的每个人都比我有更多的经验。

我终于说，去死吧，进去了。

我很高兴我做到了。

我开始定期参加，在一次会议期间，在我搬到奥马哈不久后，我遇到了一个招聘人员，他正在寻找一个Android承包商。我们谈了一会儿，那周晚些时候我得到了一份工作面试。

面试前，我感到很自信。采访中，我是一只在前大灯下的鹿。

面试官在谈论我要做的项目，结果我脑子里一片空白。我想保持订婚，但他们可以看出这超出了我的范围。

面试结束后，他们让我出去玩一个小时，这样我就可以和别人谈谈了。我知道自己搞砸了，就在市中心四处走动，想清醒头脑。

我最后和公司的其他人面谈，不久，他们给我提供了实习机会。

我很震惊，在我签下所有的文书，让我的工作笔记本电脑运行后，我去找了CEO，问它是不是带薪实习。

实习变成了一份全职工作，我开始了我的软件开发生涯。

当你自学时，人们不会来找你。你需要为自己找机会。

四年制大学和代码学校的毕业生在找到工作时，有优势利用学校的网络。自学成才的开发商没有这种奢侈。

自学的开发者需要走出去，自己建立网络。

打电话给雇主，发简历都可以。然而，我发现，人们喜欢在他们的社交网络中雇佣接近他们的人。

网站，如[Meetup.com][2] 很适合于找到每月特定于编程的组。即使在一场大流行中，仍然有许多虚拟会议非常有信息性和有益性。

还有其他松弛的渠道或不和谐的社区，您可以利用这些渠道建立有意义的关系。你也可以尝试接触你所在地区的各种人，并要求他们喝一杯15分钟的虚拟咖啡。

尽你所能建立起勇气与人接触和交谈。友好相处，和他们谈谈你的经历。确保人们知道你长期的目标是找工作。

把自己置于可能发生积极事情的情况下。如果你从不买票，你就不能赢得抽奖。

考虑任何机会，你的方式，因为即使它看起来像一个死胡同，它有可能导致更大的事情。

我的实习和我当时的其他工作相比，是一个巨大的降薪。然而，我知道如果我努力工作，那将是我进入科技产业的机会。

他关键是要从长远角度考虑工作机会。实习或兼职可能不会提前给你想要的薪水，但他们可能会在未来打开大门。
## I Hope You Learn From My Mistakes and Make Exciting New Mistakes of Your Own
